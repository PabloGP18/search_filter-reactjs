## Live Search Functionality Feature

In the process of continuous learning and improving my development skills, I built a feature that focuses on implementing live search functionality. This feature utilizes the power of JavaScript's `filter` and `map` methods, along with the state management capabilities of React.

## Data

For the sake of simplicity and to simulate a real-world scenario, I utilized [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/), an online platform that generates mock data for application development. I saved the generated data into a "data.js" file, which emulates the data received from an API call.

## Learning Purpose

The primary purpose of building this feature was educational. It allowed me to gain practical experience and understand the implementation details of live search functionality, a common feature in many modern applications. By working with mock data and simulating API responses, I got a clearer understanding of how data flow and manipulation works in real-world applications.

It's not just about building applications, sometimes it's about understanding and implementing specific features that make the application interactive and user-friendly.
